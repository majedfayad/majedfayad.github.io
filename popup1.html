          Immortality in the 21st Century <br> (A fiction) _____________________ by Herb Bowie <span class="l-2 popup-link">ALIVE</span> <br> ALIVE: (adjective) 1. (of a person, animal, or plant) living, not dead. "hopes of finding anyone still alive were fading" (synonyms: living, live <span class="l-5 popup-link">ALIVE</span> , having life, not dead).
          <br><br>
          We offer a new vision of humanity, as completely whole, beyond the polarities of life and death, spirit and body, mindand heart, male and female
          <br><br>
          Editor's Note: <span class="l-8 popup-link">ALIVE</span> <br> 
          The popular media have been focusing increased
          attention on the subject of radical life extension.
          These articles often cite promising scientific information, but all too frequently finish up <span class="l-6 popup-link">ALIVE</span> with distressing projections of dire social consequences
          that would supposedly ensue from unrestrained
          living. <span class="l-3 popup-link">ALIVE</span>
          <br><br> 
          The best example is probably a Life magazine cover story from a couple of years ago. This included a projection of the next 400 years <span class="l-3 popup-link">ALIVE</span> that made immortality seem catastrophic at worst, and merely tiresome at best. <span class="l-3 popup-link">ALIVE</span> 
          <br><br>
          In order to provide an alternative vision of our life-extended future, I've included the following account of our next 100 years. This is only one of many such possible scenarios, and I make no prophetic claims. <span class="l-4 popup-link">ALIVE</span> (((I make no prophetic claims)))
          <br><br>
          <span class="l-5 popup-link">ALIVE</span> I do hope, though, that this narrative opens your eyes to some positive possibilities, and stimulates a clearer picture of what you see for yourself in the coming century. <span class="l-8 popup-link">ALIVE</span>. 
          <br><br>
          This pioneering magazine explores the transformative powers ofembracing a life without limits. <span class="l-1 popup-link">ALIVE</span>
