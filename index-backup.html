          Editor's Note: <span class="l-8 popup-link">ALIVE</span> <br> 
          The popular media have been focusing increased
          attention on the subject of radical life extension.
          These articles often cite promising scientific information, but all too frequently finish up <span class="l-6 popup-link">ALIVE</span> with distressing projections of dire social consequences
          that would supposedly ensue from unrestrained
          living. <span class="l-3 popup-link">ALIVE</span>
          <br><br> 
          The best example is probably a Life magazine cover story from a couple of years ago. This included a projection of the next 400 years <span class="l-3 popup-link">ALIVE</span> that made immortality seem catastrophic at worst, and merely tiresome at best. <span class="l-3 popup-link">ALIVE</span> 
          <br><br>
          In order to provide an alternative vision of our life-extended future, I've included the following account of our next 100 years. This is only one of many such possible scenarios, and I make no prophetic claims. <span class="l-4 popup-link">ALIVE</span> (((I make no prophetic claims)))
          <br><br>
          <span class="l-5 popup-link">ALIVE</span> I do hope, though, that this narrative opens your eyes to some positive possibilities, and stimulates a clearer picture of what you see for yourself in the coming century. <span class="l-8 popup-link">ALIVE</span>.

          Humanity Faces the Choice to Live: 
          <br> <br>
          Many other people were equally interested in the
          Proclamation. Scientific news that had previously
          been confined to technical journals or a few
          specialty magazines suddenly began appearing in
          most of the popular media. Newspapers began running
          columns on the subject of life extension, and many
          of these quickly grew into entire sections. 
          <img src="assets/images/1.jpg"> Soon
          every major television network had at least two
          shows on the subject, and an entire cable channel
          devoted to longevity followed shortly thereafter.
          <br><br>
          Surprisingly, not everyone was excited with the
          possibility of living forever. As the number of
          people pursuing "incremental immortality"
          increased, so did active opposition to the
          movement. <img src="assets/images/4.jpg"> 
          Since every major religion was based on
          some form of an afterlife, much antagonism came
          from this quarter. Even people who were not
          particularly religious seemed to feel that
          immortality was unnatural and somehow immoral.
          Others protested that dramatically lengthening
          human life spans invited some sort of apocalyptic
          catastrophe,  <img src="assets/images/7.jpg"> such as mass starvation or economic
          collapse.
          <br><br>
          What followed was one of the most divisive social
          conflicts in history. For the first time, humanity
          was offered a clear choice between life and death.
          Science was outlining quite specific actions that
          could, when taken together, extend life spans
          dramatically. When faced with this option, many
          people declined. These same people had, a few years
          ago, before they had been given the choice, shown
          no obvious signs of wanting to die. And yet, now
          that they had turned their backs on immortality,
          they seemed to court death with a vengeance. It
          soon became apparent that there was no middle
          ground in this division that crossed all existing
          socioeconomic and demographic categories. One was
          either a "lifer," as they came to be known, or one
          turned towards death.
          <br><br>
          Paul and Sara were troubled by religious and moral
          qualms from time to time, but had their new
          direction in life constantly reinforced by the
          improving quality of their lives. They not only
          expected to  <img src="assets/images/20.jpg"> live longer in the future, they
          realized they felt better, and more alive, today.
          Of their parents, only Sara's mom was supportive of
          their decision, and even she did not choose to
          pursue life extension herself.
          <br><br>
          Paul changed jobs this year, at a significant
          decrease in salary, to get away from a boss that
          was adamantly anti-life. By the end of the year,
          Paul heard that his former boss had died of
          previously undiagnosed cancer, but by this time he
          was already firmly established at a new firm
          composed mostly of lifers, and there was no turning
          back.

          <br>
          Population Growth Stabilizes:
          <br> <br>
          People who had been worried about overpopulation by
          now realized that their fears had been misplaced.
          Although birth rates remained high in the
          diminishing number of relatively poor countries,
          they continued to decline in the richer countries,
          and especially among the lifers, more than making
          up for the decrease in the death rates. It was not
          that these longer-lived people lost any interest in
          children--on the contrary, they seemed to enjoy
          <img src="assets/images/5.jpg"> them more than ever. At the same time, the
          immortality groups offered a new social structure
          that allowed fewer children to be enjoyed by more
          people, and allowed them to be shared across
          traditional family boundaries. These groups also
          relieved many of the former disadvantages of
          raising "only children," since these children now
          had other children within the groups that they
          could play with and become close to, replacing a
          few brothers or sisters with a larger number of
          "cousins."
          <br><br>
          The declining birth rates also seemed to be caused
          by other, more subtle, factors. The span of
          people's  <img src="assets/images/8.jpg">potential childbearing years continued to  <img src="assets/images/17.jpg">
          lengthen in parallel with their total life spans.
          This created even more of an environment in which
          having a child was a matter of choice, rather than
          a pre-programmed action triggered by a biological
          time clock. Also, as people's lives lengthened, and
          the prospect of living even longer became more
          real, they seemed  <img src="assets/images/12.jpg"> less driven to achieve
          immortality through their offspring. Finally, the
          adult lifers were more childlike themselves, and
          seemed to rely less on the presence of children for
          that quality of joy so often associated with
          childhood.
          <br><br>
          <img src="assets/images/23.jpg"> 
          Paul and Sara were no exceptions. They had adjusted
          to Stephen's adulthood and departure from their
          household. Although their doctors assured them that
          they could have another child if they wanted, they
          had never seriously considered it. They were still
          close to their son, and he delighted them as much
          now as he had when he was one month old.
          <br><br>
          Stephen, meanwhile, had married a girl he had met
          and fallen in love with in college, named Maggie.
          They were open to having a child, but were in no
          hurry, and felt no pressure from their parents, who
          had plenty of friends with children of all ages.
          Stephen had become an aeronautical engineer, and
          Maggie was a journalist.

          <br>  
          A New World Order:
          <br> <br> 
          Scientists had years before established that
          emotions of human suppression, prejudice and
          hostility were life-threatening for the subjects as
          well as the objects of these feelings. This
          realization had gradually replaced strong feelings
          of racism, <img src="assets/images/2.jpg">  nationalism and separatism with an
          expanding acceptance of all human beings as fellow
          citizens of the world. Organized religion, the
          other great divider of people, had fallen into
          decline without the need of much scientific
          intervention, since people who were increasingly
          unafraid of death had little need for the comfort
          of traditional religious beliefs. 
          <img src="assets/images/3.jpg"> 
          <br><br>
          At the same time, there were feelings of devotion,
          spirituality and reverence that were found to be
          greatly life-enhancing. The immortality groups that
          now covered the globe found, however, that they did
          not need a god or a sacred text to invoke these
          feelings. Haltingly at first, and then with
          increasing abandon, they had begun to apply these
          feelings to each other. As people found they could
          <img src="assets/images/19.jpg"> 
          feel holy about themselves and other people, not
          just at these meetings but in their everyday lives,
          more and more people became converts to this new
          way of life. Immortality became the religion to end
          all religions.
          <br><br>
          With these age-old barriers to togetherness
          crumbling, national governments began to assume a
          more reasonable and restricted role in human
          affairs. The United Nations began to take on more
          of the functions formerly reserved for these
          national bodies, and it was in this year that all
          the countries of the world turned their national
          defense systems over to the control of this world
          body, to be used for peacekeeping missions only.
